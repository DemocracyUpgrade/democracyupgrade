Lets build the AI-Powered App to Enable Direct Democracy!

## Key Functionalities

AI-Powered Legislative Breakdown: Complex legislation is intelligently broken down into clear, concise, and manageable proposals, making them easier for citizens to understand and engage with.

AI-Driven Explanations and Analysis: Users receive plain-language summaries of each proposal, along with AI-generated analyses of its potential impact on individuals, communities, and society as a whole.

TikTok-style format to be seen by those within your jurisdiction, with links to legislative summaries, full legislative text on the specific proposal, other video arguments on it, and a vote button. If you feel unqualified, you can choose to delegate your vote to a trusted individual with expertise in that specific area, creating a dynamic and efficient system of informed participation.

Transparency and Accountability through Technology: A built-in system for flagging suspicious accounts, combined with community-driven checks and balances, ensures the process remains transparent, fair, and representative of the public's will. All platform activity will be cryptographically auditable, meaning it can be independently verified.
