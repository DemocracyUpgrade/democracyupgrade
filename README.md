Lets build the AI-Powered App to Enable Direct Democracy!

## Key Functionalities

AI-Powered Legislative Breakdown: Complex legislation is fetched from online sources, uploaded into the app, and intelligently broken down into clear, concise, and manageable proposals, making them easier for citizens to understand and engage with.

AI-Driven Explanations and Analysis: Users receive plain-language summaries of each proposal along with AI-generated analyses of its potential impact on individuals, communities, inequaities, economies, ecologies / biodiversities, future outcomes such as climate change, and society as a whole.

TikTok-style format to be seen by those within your jurisdiction, with links to legislative summaries, full legislative text on the specific proposal, other video arguments on it, and a vote button. If you feel unqualified, you can choose to delegate your vote to a trusted individual with expertise in that specific area, creating a dynamic and efficient system of informed participation.

Transparency and Accountability through Technology: A built-in system for flagging suspicious accounts (such as bots, individuals or accounts with a vested interest in maintaining the profit position(s) of corporations in lieu of the public good) combined with community-driven checks and balances (akin to community notes on X), ensures the process remains transparent, fair, inhibits misinformation, and representative of the public's will. All platform activity will be cryptographically auditable, meaning it can be independently verified.

Built-in AI Accuracy Audits: The community will determine the individuals responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the outputs of the AI Agent(s) that break down the legislation into its individual components as well as accuracy of the AI provided summaries and impact analysis presented to users. AI outputs will be vetted for any hallucinations, bias, or discrimination.

Legislative Editing: Users can suggest changes to pieces of legislation or submit their own proposals to be voted on.

Proposed Threshold for Enactment of Legislation: I propose that once 5% of accounts in all jurisdictions where the legislation would be applied is reached, the majority vote wins and it is either enacted or dropped. The algorithm needs to push proposals to the jurisdictions where that 5% is lacking.

Engagement Reward and Customized Experience: To keep the app entertaining, those videos with more engagement garner greater reach within the app and personal preferences for the type of content individual users prefer are considered and videos are distributed accordingly algorithmically. Preferably, this algorithm would be based on TikTok's as it seems the most successful use-case for this.

Inclusivity of all forms of legislation: The app will present all forms of legislation to be voted on including acts, bills, budgets, regulations, laws, and policies including domestic and foreign policies and any military involvement.

Scalability: Initially built from the ground up to withstand loads from a global audience so it can scale to governments internationally and ensure significant and acceptable uptime.

Future-Proof Security: Quantum and AI Resistant Algorithms / Cryptogrophy

Community Debate on Use of / Extent of Blockchain Technology: Developer community to consider whether or not blockchain should be utilized, which one, and the extent of utilization (should there be a blockchain backend and centralized frontend?)

## Proposed Use of AI Agents

Fetching Legislation:
Legalytics: This AI agent specializes in legal document analysis and can be trained to find and download legislation from government websites or legal databases.

Uploading to an App:
Zapier/IFTTT: These are automation platforms, not strictly AI agents, but they can be used to connect the AI agent that finds the legislation with your app, automatically uploading the documents.

Breaking Down Legislation:
Lex Machina: This AI agent specializes in legal analytics, including breaking down complex legal documents into key components and identifying important clauses.

Summarization:
Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4: These models excel at understanding and summarizing complex text. Fine-tuned on legal data, they can provide concise summaries of legislative components and even offer initial analysis of potential societal impacts.

Analysis of Impact if Enacted:
Policy2Go: This AI platform specifically focuses on policy analysis. It can summarize policy documents, identify stakeholders, and predict the potential impact on different groups.
FiscalNote: This platform uses AI to analyze legislation and regulations, predict their outcomes, and assess their impact on businesses and industries.
